<p><strong>Two reporters arrested and held overnight while covering Louisville protests:<br>
From CNN’s Alec Snyder-<br></p>


Two journalists with The Daily Caller, a conservative online news outlet based in Washington, DC, were arrested late Wednesday night while covering the protests in Kentucky,<br> one of the reporters told CNN Thursday.

Daily Caller reporters Jorge Ventura and Shelby Talcott were trailing a group of protesters after the 9 p.m. ET curfew when officers from<br> the Louisville Metro Police Department allegedly began firing rubber bullets at the crowd, Ventura said.

Soon after, they and Kentucky State Police ordered everyone in the protest to<br> get down on the ground, Ventura said. He added that he and Talcott showed the officers their press credentials and Talcott began communicating with their editor-in-chief, Geoffrey<br> Ingersoll, before they were arrested with zip ties.

Ventura said the protest was outside the jail where they were eventually held. Soon after arriving, Ventura said one of the superior officers<br> came in from another room asking him to confirm his identity and press affiliation, which Ventura said he did. The officer then told Ventura he was going to go speak to his editor -- who was on<br> the line -- about the situation, but when the officer came back, Ventura said he was told he would still be charged and held overnight.

Charging documents obtained by CNN show that Ventura<br> was officially charged with failing to obey a local county ordinance and failure to disperse, both of which are misdemeanors, according to what Ventura was told.

Ventura said he and Talcott were<br> eventually separated into adjacent male and female holding cells, and they could only communicate by eye contact.

Ventura said he was told he would be released “no later than 6:30 in the morning,”<br> Thursday but says he wasn’t out until 1 p.m., and still among the first of those detained to leave. He said he was detained in a holding cell with around 40 protesters, with social distancing protocols<br> not followed. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/breonna-taylor-protests-09-24-2020/index.html">More News</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>A new study has found that Seattle ranks as the No.1 overall best city in the nation for coffee and coffee lovers.

It isn't exactly a surprise that<br> Seattle - home of Starbucks, Seattle's Best Coffee and a host of excellent local coffee shops that roast their own beans - would take the top<br> ranking.

But it turns out that Seattle has plenty of competition - many other cities love their coffee, too, and take pride in their local java joints.<br>

The study, by personal finance website WalletHub to honor National Coffee Day on Sept. 29, ranked the 100 largest U.S cities across 12 key,<br> indicators of a strong coffee culture. The criteria ranged from coffee shops per capita to the average price of coffee to the number of coffee-lover<br> meetups per capita.</p>


<p>Seattle had the highest overall score of any U.S. city - and also ranked No. 1 for most affordable high-quality coffee shops per capita and most<br> coffee and tea manufacturers per capita.</p>

<p>In addition, the study found that Seattle households rank sixth in the nation for average spending on coffee per household - but only 54th in the<br> nation for the percentage of households that own a coffee maker. Go figure!

According to PBS, coffee first became popular in the U.S. after the<br> Boston Tea Party, when the switch was seen as “patriotic." And since Starbucks debuted in 1971, the drink is now accessible almost anywhere<br> you go.

Since then, research has found that caffeine possesses multiple health benefits besides mental stimulation. At the right dosages, caffeine<br> may contribute to longevity.

Perhaps just as important, though, is coffee’s social purpose. Today, coffee stations are a staple of the workplace,<br> and tens of thousands of shops serve as meeting places for friends, dates and coworkers - or they did before the COVID pandemic,<br> and will be again someday.

A recent survey by the National Coffee Association found that 62 percent of Americans drink coffee every day, with<br> the average coffee drinker consuming three cups daily.

Rounding out the top five coffee cities in America were San Francisco, at No. 2, followed<br> by Portland. Ore,; Miami, Fla.; and Tampa, Fla.

The least coffee-friendly city in the country? That would be Toledo, Ohio. Other cities in the<br> bottom five for coffee culture were Laredo, Texas; Greensboro, N.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Detroit, Mich. <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-cities-for-coffee-lovers/23739/">More on the study</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>J. Swinscoe’s the <em>Cinematic Orchestra</em> have been among the fabled Ninja Tune label’s foremost purveyors of ornate jazz funk since 1998. Thankfully, their name is not misleading<br> in the least. I recall seeing them perform at South by Southwest in the late ’90s or early ’00s, and was shocked by how much they evoked something of the Sun Ra Arkestra—not something<br>you expect from a mostly white British ensemble. They were that telepathically in sync, that uproariously uplifting, that in love with density and elegant chaos. The Cinematic Orchestra’s 2019 album,<br> To Believe, is loaded with guest vocalists and flirts with Hollywood sentimentality and a Sigur Rós–like spaciousness, but you can’t fault the exquisite skill and care with which it’s constructed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cinematic_Orchestra">More about the band.</a></strong></br></p>
